Timeline with Drag and Drop Functionality
This Timeline component displays tasks from a project on an interactive timeline, where tasks can be dragged and dropped to update their start and end dates directly within the interface. The timeline respects the allocated days for each task, providing an intuitive and interactive view for managing events.

Features
Task Display on the Timeline: Tasks are displayed as blocks, showing the task name and the start and end dates.

Drag and Drop: Tasks can be moved along the timeline, automatically updating their start and end dates.

Automatic Date Adjustment: When dragging a task, its start and end dates are adjusted based on the taskâ€™s position on the timeline.
